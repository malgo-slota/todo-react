### What I've learned

The main purpose of the app was to train React.js concepts and it is fulfilled. Now I am confident with my knowledge about using props and state, what is lifting up state, hooks (useEffect and useState) I get better understanding in React app structure. I've learned how to store data in local storage.
I'm impressed by how React makes code more readable, apps more efficient, and I will continue to curiously develop my skills in this library.
